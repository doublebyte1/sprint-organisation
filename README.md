# ðŸš€ Introduction

These code sprints are focused on a small number of specifications (3 at most). They can be organized by SWG or DWG members, with the Chairs of the participating SWGs or DWGs taking responsibility for the organization and execution of the code sprints. OGC Staff will provide support limited to deconfliction of the event schedule, promotion of the event on OGC social media channels, and provision of the online collaboration platform (i.e. GitHub and Gotomeeting/Discord).
