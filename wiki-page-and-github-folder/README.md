# Wiki page and GitHub folder

The [developer-events wiki page](https://github.com/opengeospatial/developer-events/wiki), contains information about past and upcoming code sprints.&#x20;

Each code sprint has a dedicated page with the logistics and anything else participants should know, before, during and after the code sprint. The intention is to update it as a live document, and to accept contributions from the community.

The [associated GitHub repository](https://github.com/opengeospatial/developer-events), is used to hold files associated to the code sprint (e.g.: presentations).

The recommendation is to create the wiki page as soon as possible, even with minimal information. In the next sections, we explain how-to create this page and associated folder through the GitHub UI. In alternative, you could clone the GitHub repository, do the hanges on your local machine and commit & push the result.
