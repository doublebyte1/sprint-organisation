# During the code sprint

#### Starting Events

When the time of the event comes, start it, by clicking on the event and bringing the three-dots menu, next to the share button. Once you start the event, it will be announced in the server.

You can end the event, by leaving the channel where the event os taking place.

#### Recording Audio

It is possible to record audio of the discord meetings, using the [craig bot](https://craig.chat/), installed on the server.

In order to record, go to one of the text channels under the `staff` section and type:

`/join channel:Main Stage ðŸ‘¥` (replace Main Stage ðŸ‘¥, by the name of the channel you want to record.

There will be an acknowledgement message on the channel, which includes a `stop` button. Do not forget to stop the recording, either by clicking the `stop` button, or by typing:

`/leave channel:Main Stage ðŸ‘¥`

Once you start recording, the craig bot will send you a private message which contains a link to download the recording. The link will expire within 7 days.

If you click the download link, it will take you to a an external webpage to download the recording. I find it that this operation works best on Safari. Choose the single track mixing in AAC format and wait for it to process the track (this may take a while, an it is quite intensive on the CPU).

When the track is ready, you can download it and put it somewhere accessible (e.g.: OGC portal). [Then you can update the schedule on the wiki with the link for the recording](https://test-186.gitbook.io/code-sprint-organization-for-wgs/wiki-page-and-github-folder/maintaining-the-wiki-page).

#### &#x20;Closing Session

Usually the last session (demo & wrap up) is held in [GotoMeet](https://www.goto.com/meeting), in order to enable video recording.

Ahead of the session, create a goto meeting link (ask OGC staff, if needed) and update the schedule on the [wiki page](https://test-186.gitbook.io/code-sprint-organization-for-wgs/wiki-page-and-github-folder/adding-a-new-wiki-page) with the link. When adding the event on discord, you should publish this link.

Once you are in GoToMeet, start the recording. After downloading the recording, you can upload it to the OGC portal. The portal has a hard limit on file sizes, so reduce it first using an transcoder software (e.g.: [handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/)).

Update the schedule on the wiki, with the link to the video recording.
