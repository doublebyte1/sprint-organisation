description: How-to add a wiki page for a code sprint
---

# Adding a new event page

You can start by adding a menu entry for the code sprint at the [wiki home page](https://github.com/opengeospatial/developer-events/wiki), by clicking on the "edit" button. If you want, copy the information from the previous row and customize it. The first column is the number of the code sprint: you can increase one number from the previous enrty. This type of code sprints do not have a website, so you can leave the link empty.&#x20;

The last column is the link to the wiki page. Choose a name that matches the name of the code sprint, with spaces replaced by \`-\`; for instance: [https://github.com/opengeospatial/developer-events/wiki/Sample-Code-Sprint](https://github.com/opengeospatial/developer-events/wiki/Sample-Code-Sprint)
